/**
 * BaseRepository serves as an abstract class that defines the 
 * structure for repository classes in the authentication service.
 * It provides method signatures for common database operations 
 * such as creating a new record, finding a record by ID, username, or email, 
 * and retrieving all records. Each method throws an error indicating that it
 * is not implemented, which enforces that any subclass must provide its own 
 * implementation of these methods.
